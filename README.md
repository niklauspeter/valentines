# Valentine's Day Proposal Project

This project is a sweet and playful web page designed to facilitate a cheeky Valentine's Day Proposal to your partner . The web page features a romantic background, a proposal question (will you be my valentines? ) with "Yes" and "No" buttons as possible answers.

The cheeky bit is that the 'No' button moves away each time it's clicked, thereby making 'Yes' the only possible option.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Open the Files:**
   Open the project files in your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

3. **Run the Project:**
   Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to experience the interactive proposal page.

## Features

- **Proposal Interface:**
  - Romantic background with a proposal question.
  - "Yes" and "No" buttons.

- **Congratulations Page:**
  - Displays a congratulatory message.
  - Small image at the center.

- **Interactive "No" Button:**
  - On the first press, changes the image and text in the center on the proposal page.
  - On subsequent presses, moves the "No" button aside in different directions, as different memes pop up at the center of the page. Ultimately, the user would have to click the "Yes" button the as it's the only clickable option.

## Customization

- **Background Image:**
  - Replace `'your-background-image.jpg'` in `index.html` with your preferred background image path.

  - Replace `'initial-image.jpg'` and `'new-image.jpg'` in `index.html` and `script.js` with the paths to your images.
